Using tu56 on RSX-11
********************

Use the PDP-11 DECtape driver:

  cd 
  cd Tu56/simh/pdp11_dectape_driver
  chmod +x install
  ./install

Building a new version of SimH with install will take a while, especially on slower
Raspberry Pi models. The new TC driver generates a status byte in /tmp/tu56status,
which can be used by tu56.

Unfortunately the standard RSX-11 disk on the PiDP-11 distribution software does not
have the DECtape driver enabled. The disk and instructions below have been provided
by Neal G.

First, I recommend to make a backup copy of your current /opt/pidp11/systems/rsx11mplus
directory.

Then, copy the disk and boot.ini file provided in the rsx11 directory of this repo to
/opt/pidp11/systems/rsx11mplus

  cd
  cd Tu56/rsx11
  sudo cp rsx11m102.tgz /opt/pidp11/systems/rsx11mplus
  sudo cp boot.ini /opt/pidp11/systems/rsx11mplus
  cd /opt/pidp11/systems/rsx11mplus
  sudo tar xvf rsx11m102.tgz

You have now a bootable an image of a bootable disk and a DECtape in your rsx11mplus
directory.

Boot up to RSX11mplus as usual. Then mount the DECtape

  ctrl-e
  simh> attach tc0 test2-tu56.tap
  simh> cont

  $ mount dt0: test02
  $ dir dt0: /free
