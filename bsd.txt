Using tu56 with SimH on the PiDP-11, running 2.11 BSD
*****************************************************

Using tu56 as a tape device:
****************************

First, install the modified TQ driver in SimH as follows. It's a good idea to make a
backup copy of /opt/pidp11 before doing that, in case something goes wrong.

  cd 
  cd Tu56/simh/pdp11_magtape_driver
  chmod +x install
  ./install

Building a new version of SimH with install will take a while, especially on slower
Raspberry Pi models. The new TQ driver adds realistic timing and generates a status
byte in /tmp/tu56status, which can be used by tu56.

If you want to go back to the original driver, type

  cd 
  cd tu56/simh/pdp11_magtape_driver
  chmod +x uninstall
  ./uninstall

You have to restart simh after installing the new driver. The easiest way to do this
is to restart your Raspberry Pi.

Also, don't forget to enable the TQ driver in your boot.ini, see
https://github.com/rricharz/pidp11-2.11bsd.git.
You have to restart 2.11 BSD after changing boot.ini.

Now you are ready to use the tu56 front panel with the PiDP-11. Just start the front
panel at any time. It does not matter whether this is done before or after SimH and
BSD are started. The only thing which is important is that the right switch on the
left drive on the tu56 front panel is set to the "REMOTE" position. Boot to 2.11 BSD,
and use commands like "tar cv filename" or "tar xv filename" to see the tape in action.
It is much more fun to use "tar" if you can see the tape in action.

Note: on early Unix systems like System 6 it was possible to use the DECtape drives
using the "tp" command, with arguments very similar to "tar", but using the DECtape
driver. Because there is no DECtape driver for 2.11 BSD available, we are using the
TQ magtape driver to access the tape drive in 2.11 BSD.

Talking to both tape drives with 2.11 BSD
*****************************************

Put the following in your BSD boot.ini:

  set tq enabled
  attach tq0 tq0tape.tap
  attach tq1 tq1tape.tap

Now you can use tar to write to drive 0 and drive 1. The default is drive 0.

  tar cvf /dev/rmt0 filename
  tar cvf /dev/rmt1 filename

You can list the tape directory with

  tar tvf /dev/rmt0
  tar tvf /dev/rmt1

And you can read back an individual file with

  tar xvf /dev/rmt0 filename
  tar xvf /dev/rmt1 filename

or all files without the file name argument.

Using tu56 as a DECtape device:
*******************************

This mode requires the installation of a modified kernel for DECtape. With thies
kernel, the DECtapes can be used like floppy disks:

For details, see https://github.com/vlait/211bsd-tc11

Put the following in your boot.ini

  ; enable 2 DECtape devices
  set tc enabled
  set tc address=17777340
  set tc vector=214
  attach tc0 tu0.tu56
  attach tc1 tu1.tu56

and at the very end of boot.ini, after the "boot rq0":

  ; flush DECtape buffers
  detach tc0
  detach tc1

Finally, install the modified TC driver in SimH as follows. It's a good idea to make a
backup copy of /opt/pidp11 before doing that, in case something goes wrong.

  cd 
  cd Tu56/simh/pdp11_dectape_driver
  chmod +x install
  ./install

Building a new version of SimH with install will take a while, especially on slower
Raspberry Pi models. The new TC driver adds realistic timing and generates a status
byte in /tmp/tu56status, which can be used by tu56.
